Vehicle Maintenance Tracker
===========================

This is an exercise in object-oriented programming techniques using the pinnacle of modern, object-oriented design, JavaScript.

Joking aside, whilst JavaScript is lacking features typically associated with OOP, such as strong typing, member access control and a well defined method of inheritance, it is entirely possible to build well designed classes and inheritance hierarchies.

This application uses inheritance (`Vehicle` and `MaintenanceOperation` are base classes), composition (vehicles have maintenance operations, the garage has vehicles) and some familiar OOD patterns (such as the `VehicleFactory`).

The web interface and unit tests are viewable via [GitHub pages](http://andypaxo.github.io/vehicle-maintenance). Or, just download and unpack the whole project.
